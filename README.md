# Introduction

This is the beginning of my attempt to create a bare-bones getting-things-done (GTD) webapp. 

# What's the point of this?

I need a todo management system that: 
* works in a browser
* is ubiquitiously accessible
* gives me an excuse to learn DevOps technologies like Vagrant and Ansible.

This isn't particularly novel or interesting as an app, but it might help somwone else learn how this stuff works.

# Getting Started

Install the following:
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* Ansible

Then, clone this repo, open a terminal, and bring the environment up.

    vagrant up
