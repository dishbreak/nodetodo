# Introduction

This is the beginning of my attempt to create a bare-bones getting-things-done (GTD) webapp. 

# What's the point of this?

I need a todo management system that: 
* works in a browser
* is ubiquitiously accessible
* gives me an excuse to learn DevOps technologies like Vagrant and Ansible.

This isn't particularly novel or interesting as an app, but it might help someone else learn how this stuff works.

# Useful References

Here's a list of the the references I've used to create this:

* [RESTful API User Authentication with Node.js and AngularJS](https://devdactic.com/restful-api-user-authentication-1/) - Excellent tutorial from Simon Reimler over at devdactic that lays out how to use JSON Web Tokens.

# Getting Started

Install the following:
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* Ansible

Then, clone this repo, open a terminal, and bring the environment up.

    vagrant up
